I did a practice session with Git and in my opinion GUI is far easier to use. I struggle remembering all of the specific folder and file names, and am more of a visual person. But of course there are things to counter this, for example the ls command which pulls up all of the files and ls -F which shows directories as well. For me personally and for many I still believe things are faster with GUI. I imagine that there are some circumstances though in which Command-line is better, especially during a coding project. I imagine it would be easier to just type in the name of a directory then have to search through countless folders to find what you are looking for, as long as you know what it is called.
