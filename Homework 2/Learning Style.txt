My learning style actually was what I expected for the most part! I anticipated a slightly more tactile percentage, I think I learn well when actually doing the work. I have always thought visual was my primary style though so I’m not surprised. I think I will just watch tutorials when I need help, and also try it myself. I am also going to make sure I’m focused on my main monitor when working. It says that visuals get distracted easily if there are other things to look at and I agree with that. Please just keep being you! You always find a way to help me, I’m so glad I get you as a professor! If I come up with any ideas later down the line I’m sure I will let you know.
