I thought the Mindset quiz was quite interesting! The questions asked were relatively easy to answer but I struggled with some. My score is lower than I expected. I would say that my perspective on mindset hasn’t changed tremendously, but certainly in some areas. I am going to try to practice a better mindset especially when I am depressed or when I’m being too hard on myself. I think it will affect my outlook. If you look at life through a more positive lens it stays more positive.
