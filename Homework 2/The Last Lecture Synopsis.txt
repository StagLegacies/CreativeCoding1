I thought that the Last Lecture was incredible. Right away he started with his condition and his future, and it amazed me how enthusiastic he still was. Regardless of his future he chose to stay happy and just that really impacted my view on life. He then continued to talk about his dreams and how he went about accomplishing, or almost, accomplishing all of them. 
I saved several quotes from his lecture and the ones that affected me the most. These are the first two: “When you are screwing up, and nobody says anything to you anymore, that means they have given up on you. It is one of the worst spots to be in.” “Critics are the ones telling you they still love you and care.” These two were really big for me. I really value my relationships with people and I think it is one of the biggest contributing factors to accomplishing dreams. Looking back at all of my greatest accomplishments, I have always had people behind me helping me push. So these quotes not only helped me make up my mind that I was not going to only always accept help, but I will try to always offer it as well. 
The next quotes affected me more than explainable: “Experience is what you get when you didn’t get what you wanted.” “The brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how bad we want something. They are there to stop the people who don’t want it bad enough.” I have some really big ambitions, and I am going to fail a lot, I already have. And what he said here really changed my perspective on things. I am usually really hard on myself, but after hearing this part of the lecture I was really proud of myself. I realize now that I have kept going. I have not gotten even close to what I wanted but regardless I always pushed. I will continue to do this and will look back on this when I forget that I am doing quite well, even when I feel like I’m not. I just need to keep going. 
Finally I’m going to add a list that I think is also some very good advice. 
* “Get a feedback loop; and listen to it”
* Show gratitude! 
* Don’t complain; just work harder. 
* Be good at something it makes you valuable
* Find the best in everybody; no matter how long you have to wait to see it
* Be prepared: “luck” is where preparation meets opportunity
Everything on this list is advice that I intend to carry with me my whole life. It not only applies to personal dreams, but just life in general, and I think that’s what the whole lecture really was about. I would say I identified with 95% of that lecture, and I doubt I will forget it. It’s my turn to fulfill my dreams, and help others fulfill theirs.
